CodeFellows Challenge: Object-oriented-JS
=========================
As part of my application to Code Fellows, I was asked to create use object-oriented JavaScript to model a public library. Hadn't written a single line of Javascript code prior to this code challenge. Purpose of challenge is to see how quickly I would be able to learn new technology. 

Additional details:
  - Three classes: Library, Shelf, & Book). 
  - The library should be aware of a number of shelves. Each shelf should know what books it contains. 
  - Make the book object have "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that control what shelf the book is sitting on. 
  - The library should have a method to report all books it contains.
